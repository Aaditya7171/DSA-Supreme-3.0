30 Prime Number Check: Write a program to check if a given number is a prime number or not.


Problems of the day 11:
31.Write a program to check if a given year is a <leap year> or not. 
A leap year is a year that is evenly divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400.
Example: 2000 and 2008 are leap years, while 1900 is not a leap year.

32. Write a program to check if a given number is an <abundant number> or not.
An abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself.
Example: 12 is an abundant number because the sum of its proper divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) equals 16, which is greater than 12.

33. Write a program to print the <Fibonacci series> up to a given number of terms.
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
Example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...


Problems of the day 12:
34. Write a program to set the K-th bit of a given number.
Given a number N and a position K, set the K-th bit of N to 1.
Example: If the number is 5 (binary 101) and K is 1, after setting the first bit (from right to left), the resulting number should be 4 (binary 100).

35. Write a program to count all set bits in a given number.
Given a number N, count the number of set bits (bits with a value of 1) in its binary representation.
Example: For the number 7 (binary 111), there are three set bits.

36. Write a program to create a number using bits according to a given pattern.
Given a specific pattern or condition, create a number using bits.
Example: Creating the largest possible number with 4 bits results in 15 (binary 1111).
